## Statuses
-  Traitor, while working for or after quitting/retiring, being seen by a military ship after joining and while participating in an enemy factions military or support mission.  Consequence: No more paycheck or pension. Relation set to -25.
* accepted work missions need to add a faction flag, then military job ships that detect player with flag marked as traitor?


# Stealing Ships Phase
- military and police ships detect player's stolen ships
  - stolen ships get attacked on sight by 
- sell ships
  - verify ai scripts run correctly

* Requires relationship 25
  -  increase sabotage missions when spy

# Late Game
## Player Economy Changes
- Research costs increased to 2x module's and 10x ship's sell price (same as buying blueprint from factionrep).

- lootboxes
  - bank
    - but killing them currently drops inventory lootboxes that the player will be able to open (risky) or use a security bypass to open them (might take more than one bypass, but risk-free) maybe 100k each box.. or maybe a bomb.. 100k is a lot in getting a job.
    - hmm boarding them could transfer more lootboxes to the player, or nearest player-owned ship if the player isn't nearby.
  - npc ships drop credits + cargo
    - boarding cargo ships... could give credits and the ship when succesful

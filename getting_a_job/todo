-- Player Economy Changes --

- Research costs increased to 2x module's and 10x ship's sell price (same as buying blueprint from factionrep).

- increase contraband profitability when working for a pirate faction
event check sold ware by player contraband increase by 25%?

- stolen ships are stolen, use them away from the faction (and their non-enemies) that they were stolen from or recycle them at your shipyard to try to reverse engineer them. can't sell them to non-pirate factions (legit salvaged ships are not stolen)
would need to mark a ship as stolen when attacked (and pilot bails) and when boarded. but if the player didn't attack the ship before the pilot bailed, then it'd be legitimate salvage, and it wouldn't be stolen. and and if the pilot bails but the player attacked in self-defense, then it wouldn't be considered stolen (not sure when that'd happen but self-defense is in the crime has consequences mod). ah, can only give variables to the ai pilot, not the ship... so hmm
kuertee creates a criminal ship database. so i guess i'll just use the same database for it


-- Retirement
- (pension level variable check): Quit at any time or Retire after reaching pension levels.  ? retiring necessary?
- mdpaydelay (total mission rewards variable): Pension based on total pay received.

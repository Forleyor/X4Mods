# Features
- military and police ships detect player's stolen ships
  - stolen ships get attacked on sight by 

## Statuses
-  Deserter, not completing any military or support missions within last (60/120/240)? minutes. Consequence: Paycheck paused until next mission is completed.
* reset delay cue when mission complete

-  Traitor, while working for or after quitting/retiring, being seen by a military ship after joining and while participating in an enemy factions military or support mission.  Consequence: No more paycheck or pension. Relation set to -25.
* accepted work missions need to add a faction flag, then military job ships that detect player with flag marked as traitor?

## Jobs

-  Spy, allows joining enemy factions (will still become a traitor if participating in a military mission against your primary faction, and traitor status by the other faction as normal). Consequence: Spy bonus added to paycheck from main faction plus paycheck from other faction.
* Requires relationship 25
  -  increase sabotage missions when spy
* disable turrets, shields, (kuertee's professions list?)

## Player Economy Changes
- Research costs increased to 2x module's and 10x ship's sell price (same as buying blueprint from factionrep).

- increase contraband profitability when working for a pirate faction
event check sold ware by player contraband increase by 25%?

- sell ships
  - verify ai scripts run correctly
  - ships must be docked at a station to sell them (stolen ships are forfeited upon docking depending upon station faction)
  - player selling ships to the ai's stations, be the vanilla 100% price

- lootboxes
  - bank
    - but killing them currently drops inventory lootboxes that the player will be able to open (risky) or use a security bypass to open them (might take more than one bypass, but risk-free) maybe 100k each box.. or maybe a bomb.. 100k is a lot in getting a job.
    - hmm boarding them could transfer more lootboxes to the player, or nearest player-owned ship if the player isn't nearby.
  - npc ships drop credits + cargo
    - boarding cargo ships... could give credits and the ship when succesful

## Pensions and Descendants
- Pension transfered to descendant
  - Pension based on total pay received.
  - 1% per mission isn't that much... 1000 = 10 vs 10000 paycheck... 

## Piracy
- missions
  - assassinate missions (combat focused criminals)
  - smuggling (trade focused criminals)
  - raids (attack ships, get them to drop credits instead of destroying them)
  - board ships
  - sell stolen ship's and their cargo to the pirate station manager instead of normal (they'd pay maybe 25% or 50% of the cargo's average price, but buy everything) 
  - transfer purchased cargo to the nearest tradestation by pirate cargo ships... or magic

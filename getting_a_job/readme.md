# Getting a Job.

## Features
Life isn't easy. It's a grind. The rich get richer and the poor...slowly get richer. Owning even a single multi-crew ship (size_m) is a big deal. Starting a company, having a fleet of traders, your own militia? Yeah... dream big. It will take you a while to get there. Fast cash? Become a pirate and kill everything, or die trying. Tho, maybe you could go work for your faction, earn a steady paycheck. I mean why not? The turtle was faster than the rabbit, in the end. Now go find that representative.

### Ship Prices
- The cost of purchasing ships has been increased to match their hull, and scale with their size.
  - Chassis prices based on hull hp: 
    S: no changes
    M: 40xhull (current ~5.5-14x) ~3x more military (Corellian Corvette = 6.6m from 2.4m), ~7x more (miner/freighter/builder = 2.9m from 400k)
    L: 60xhull (current ~4.6-20x) ~3.5x more military (Nebulan B Frigate = 15.87m from 4m), ~13x more (miner/freighter/builder = 33m from 2.5m)
    XL: 100xhull (current ~12-27x) ~4x more (ISD-1 = 200m from 47m, 137m from 37m), ~9x more (auxiliary = 93m from 10.8m)
    XXL: 200xhull (current ~36.5x) ~5.5x more (Resurgent SD = 840m from 153m)

### Rewards Decreased
- Rewards for missions, profits from buying inventory items low and selling high, profits from selling craftables and looted items, profits from transporting software and deployables from low price to high price stations. Gone. Not really gone, but it's not how you'll get rich. Maybe missions, but not really trading the small stuff. Go become a pirate and loot lots of stuff, that's the easy way to become rich, or dead.
  - Rewards reduced to 12.5% of normal.
  - Average prices reduced to 20% of normal.
  - Price spreads reduced to 12.5% of normal.

## Planned Features
### Main Feature
- Get a job working for a faction's government, available at (10/15/20)? relationship. Receive a paycheck deposited direct to player, or InterGalactic Bank account every (6/10/15/20/30/60)? minutes. Basic paycheck for joining, plus additonal tiers based on Combat and Support performance.

- Additional pay types:
Combat pay based on completing raid/defend mission, getting patrol kills (not station civilian criminal). 
Support pay for trading with faction stations (buying and selling) and completing support missions.

- Retirement
Quit at any time.
Retire after reaching pension levels.
Multiple pension levels, based on total pay received (basic/combat/support).

### New Statuses
- Deserter: not completing any military or support missions within last (60/120/240)? minutes. Consequence: Paycheck paused until next mission is completed.

- Traitor: while working for or after quitting/retiring, being seen by a military ship after joining and while participating in an enemy factions military or support mission. Consequence: No more paycheck or pension. Relation set to -25.

- Spy: (requires relationship 25 and first? pension level), allows joining other factions (will still become a traitor if participating in a military mission against your primary faction, and traitor status by the other faction as normal). Consequence: Spy bonus added to paycheck from main faction plus paycheck from other faction.

### Player Economy Changes
- Research costs increased to 2x module's and 10x ship's sell price (same as buying blueprint from faction rep).

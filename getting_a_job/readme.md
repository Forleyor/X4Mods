## Planned Features
### Main Feature
- Get a job working for a faction's government, available at (10/15/20)? relationship. Receive a paycheck deposited direct to player, or InterGalactic Bank account every (6/10/15/20/30/60)? minutes. Basic paycheck for joining, plus additonal tiers based on Combat and Support performance.

- Additional pay types:
Combat pay based on completing raid/defend mission, getting patrol kills (not station civilian criminal). 
Support pay for trading with faction stations (buying and selling) and completing support missions.

- Retirement
Quit at any time.
Retire after reaching pension levels.
Multiple pension levels, based on total pay received (basic/combat/support).

### New Statuses
- Deserter: not completing any military or support missions within last (60/120/240)? minutes. Consequence: Paycheck paused until next mission is completed.

- Traitor: while working for or after quitting/retiring, being seen by a military ship after joining and while participating in an enemy factions military or support mission. Consequence: No more paycheck or pension. Relation set to -25.

- Spy: (requires relationship 25 and first? pension level), allows joining other factions (will still become a traitor if participating in a military mission against your primary faction, and traitor status by the other faction as normal). Consequence: Spy bonus added to paycheck from main faction plus paycheck from other faction.

### Player Economy Changes
- Reward for completing missions is divided by 8 (12.5% of normal).

- Price spread of inventory goods (min and max sell prices) are divided by 8 (12.5% of normal). For example, 1000 average price can be bought for min 875 and max 1125. All inventory goods average prices divided by 5 (20% of normal).

- Buying ships is more expensive; increased chassis price (cost of building them is not changed):

 - Chassis prices based on hull hp: 
    S: no changes
    M: 40xhull (current ~5.5-14x) ~3x more military (Corellian Corvette = 6.6m from 2.4m), ~7x more (miner/freighter/builder = 2.9m from 400k)
    L: 60xhull (current ~4.6-20x) ~3.5x more military (Nebulan B Frigate = 15.87m from 4m), ~13x more (miner/freighter/builder = 33m from 2.5m)
    XL: 100xhull (current ~12-27x) ~4x more (ISD-1 = 200m from 47m, 137m from 37m), ~9x more (auxiliary = 93m from 10.8m)
    XXL: 200xhull (current ~36.5x) ~5.5x more (Resurgent SD = 840m from 153m)

- Research costs increased to 2x module's and 10x ship's sell price (same as buying blueprint from factionrep).

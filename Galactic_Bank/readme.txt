-Loot Boxes-
Credit loot boxes drop from Banker Clan owned objects (including destroying a vault, but destroy a vault and everyone with a vault gets mad, super mad)
Rewards and reputation for finding and turning in the credit loot boxes.
Chance of large reputation decrease for opening credit loot boxes (unknown amount of credits, usually a lot, might not be; same large reputation decrease regardless of amount)
Use a Security Bypass to attempt to open it without risk. Might succeed on first try. Might require multiple.

-Bank Offices-
Branch offices will only be in stations owned by major factions with a functioning branch vault station.

-Bounty Hunters-
Bounty hunters will hunt you when your banking rep hits -10. Factions with vaults will drop to and freeze at -10 when you hit -20 banking rep.

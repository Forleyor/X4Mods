# Issues
- What happens when a vault's sector changes ownership? dismantle station if new owner already has station?

# Loans
- Bank Loans (collateral requirement based on relations, fear the repo man)

# modifications
- galactic bank branch offices only when vault is operational
  - $MajorFactionList.{$vault.sector.owner} to false when a vault is not operational.
  - $MajorFactionList.{$vault.sector.owner} to true when rebuilt station isoperational.

# Piracy
- add credit loot boxes for destroyed vaults (solid storage modules)
add drop to component macro? check if component destroyed?
